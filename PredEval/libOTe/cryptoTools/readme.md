=====


CryptoTools is a portable c++14 library containing a collection of tools for building cryptographic protocols. This include asynchronous networking (Boost Asio), several fast primitives such as AES (AES-NI), Blake2, SHA1 (assembly), and eliptic curve crypto (Relic-Toolkit). There are also several other utilities tailered for implementing protocols.

Thirdparty networking is also supported. See `frontend_cryptoTools/tutorial/Network.cpp` for an example.
  

 
## Install
 
The library is *cross platform* and has been tested on both Windows, Linux and Mac. There are two **optional dependencies** including [Boost 1.69](http://www.boost.org/) (networking), and [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/) for elliptic curves. 

### Windows

In `Powershell`, this will set up the project 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools
cd cryptoTools/thirdparty/win
[build boost at c:\libs\boost or thirdparty\win\boost]
cd ../..
cmake .
```

 * See `cmake .` for build options.

**Enable elliptic curves using:**
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_RELIC=ON`: Build the library with integration to the 
      [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/) library. Requires that
      relic is built with `cmake . -DMULTI=OPENMP` and installed.

**Boost and visual studio:**  If boost does not build with visual studio 2017+
follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41464356/build-boost-with-msvc-14-1-vs2017-rc). 

### Unix
 
 In short, this will build the project (without elliptic curves)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools
cd thirdparty/linux
bash boost.get
cd ../..
make
```

This will build the minimum version of the library (wihtout elliptic curves).
 To see all the command line options, execute the program 
 
`./frontend_libOTe`


**Enable elliptic curves using:**
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_RELIC=ON`: Build the library with integration to the 
      [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/) library. Requires that
      relic is built with `cmake . -DMULTI=PTHREAD` and installed.

**Note:** In the case that miracl or boost is already installed, the steps 
`cd cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux; bash boost.get` can be skipped and CMake will attempt 
to find them instead. Boost is found with the CMake findBoost package.
